The program Dungeon_Generation creates a dungeon with rooms using "."s and paths using "#". The program has 3 functions. Main calls makeDungeon(), where the entire dungeon is created and checked. The end of makeDungeon() calls printDungeon() which then prints out the dungeon. This is a rudimentary base that does not use an array of rooms to keep track but rather an array of coordinates where the top-left corner is passed. In later implementations I will have the x and y coordinates passed too so that I can know where the room is in the Dungeon grid.
