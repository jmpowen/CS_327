		Got started on the project. First created place_PC which puts the player character
		in a random room with a random x, y. Started working on Dijkstras too with my code.
		8PM
		Realized I had some of my code break after checking load and save. I then made 
		the decision to switch to Jeremy's code.
		10PM
		Finally finished understanding his code and why he wrote it. Learned all the structs
		and what they do. I learned how his Dijkstra's corridor worked and the methods in
		heap.c worked too.
		11PM
		Started on Dijkstras path finder for non tunneling monsters. Realized I did not
		understand his code like I thought I did. Proceeded to relearn his code for Dijkstra's
		and why he did what he did.

		1230AM
		Finished for the night. Completed most of my path finder for corridors.
		11AM
		Finished up my path finder for the corridors and started it for the whole map. Minor
		changed needed to be made so this was an easy finish.
		12PM
		Finished the project.
9/24/18		10PM
		Checked my load function with djikstras and had to fix a minor error involving the
		player placement.
