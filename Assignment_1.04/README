My program takes in a --nummon switch and you can either set it to a value you'd like or it defaults to 10(with/without the switch). The code runs really well and the methods I added are all at the bottom of dungeon.c. My program accounts for all 16 possible types of monsters and ends with the PC being killed. The play_dungeon is called in main within rlg327.c. This has the heap in it and the characters are added as nodes to this heap. The while loop runs through as many iterations as it takes for pc to die or all npcs to die. My macros CHECK_INT CHECK_TUN CHECK_TEL and CHECK_ERR help to tell me which function to pass it to for it's next move. Moves follow the guidelines set out.
