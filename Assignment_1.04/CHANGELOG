9/30/18	3PM	Reviewed the assignment, downloaded the instructor's code and started to write
		character_t struct and add components needed to have all that players and npcs would
		need.
9/30/18	9PM	Completed nummon switch and got monsters to generate randomly in a single board.
10/1/18	11AM	Started reading the heap implementation and confused myself to the point of needing
		a hard reset so I took a day off from the project.
10/2/18 9PM	Started using the heap after a friend, a TA, and another friend explained to me how
		heaps work again and how Jeremy's code works. Super simple implementation after 
		slogging through all that gibberish(but I'm sure it runs very cleanly).
10/2/18	11PM	Made the fatal decision to get it done this night rather than tomorrow in the day.
10/3/18 12AM	Completed my understanding of how heap has to be implemented and used(WHY IS THERE
		NO NODES NEEDED IN CHARACTER BUT THANK G ITS THAT WAY). Ran valgrind and gdb to debug
		at this point. Got my code lookin all spiffy, no seg faults, no leaks.
10/3/18 12:10AM Started writing more to move player and move the npcs. Figured out a way that seemed
		to minimalized the amount of code needed and started writing my play method which 
		calls the rest of the methods on how to move, caused a bunch of headaches because
		valgrind showed leaks and I was coding poorly.
10/3/18	9AM	Project pretty much completed except for valgrind issues and minor edits to moving
		I kept making throughout the day.
10/3/18 4PM	Submitting a version with only a little bit of leaks.
