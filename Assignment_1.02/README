The file runs as it should. It is in a while loop until i meents argc-1 and exits. It will follow all possible legal commands. The first file saved when you call save multiple times will be the only dungeon saved. Load will create a dungeon if there is none there, as according to the spec. If save is the first one in it will create a dungeon and then follow the according commands(--load, loads that same dungeon back in, --save, saves the same dungeon back).
