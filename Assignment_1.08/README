This files creates monsters and items from the file given to the program. The monsters are read in and created. Then the items are configured and put into the dungeon. The playable version of the game shows colors for different items and monsters. I changed the file direction in descriptions.cpp because I had the description_files directory in the tar file and I downloaded that to a specific location on my computer.
