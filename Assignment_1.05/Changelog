10/10/18	9PM	Started working on the project. Began by making a stairs struct then moving
			into a new file for the pc interaction called interaction.c. Made a new render
			 dungeon that refreshes the page for each new move by the character. It prints
			 out the map after a cycle has completed. 
10/11/18	3PM	Started on player movement and controlling that with the given user controls 				in the pdf. The map is controlled by the player and updates for ones that are 				killed by the pc. The stairs lead to a new generated dungeon and going back 
			creates an entirely new dungeon rather than leading to a dungeon previously 
			explored. 
10/14/18	3PM	Finished product just testing and fixing minor bugs with the program, like 
			giving a dead monster to the monster map and not killing the monster when the 
			player takes a space with a monster in it.
